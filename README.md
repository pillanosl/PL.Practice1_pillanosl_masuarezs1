*Resume: In this project, we carried out the practice proposed by the programming languages teacher Alexander Narváez Berrío. We develop a system called "creation of living beings", dividing them into two main categories: those that belong to the sky and those that belong to the earth. Living beings from earth will not be able to access certain characteristics of beings from the sky, except for humans. In addition, we will implement the Factory design pattern, using a common Creator interface for both types of living beings.
