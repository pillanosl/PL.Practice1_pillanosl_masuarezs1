## Overview

This project is a practice assignment given by our programming languages teacher, Alexander Narváez Berrío. We have developed a system called "Creation of Living Beings", which categorizes beings into two main groups: those belonging to the sky and those belonging to the earth. Earthly beings have restricted access to certain characteristics of sky beings, except for humans. Additionally, we have implemented the Factory design pattern, utilizing a common Creator interface for both types of living beings.
